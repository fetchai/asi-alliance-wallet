1. ## <a name="_toc_250003"></a>Staking

Staking is the process of locking up some of your tokens to take part in the functioning of a blockchain network, boost its security, and receive some passive dividends. Proof-of-stake (POS) is the consensus protocol used by the open, decentralized blockchain network Fetch. For the operators of POS-based networks, sometimes referred to as validators, to be eligible for rewards from their    labor, they must lock up some tokens.

A validator must fulfil number of requirements, such as staking a minimum number of tokens. Users with fewer tokens could still participate by allocating stake to a certain validator to obtain a portion of the profits.

To stack or unstack, simply follow these steps-

1. Make sure you are logged into your Fetch wallet before you stake.
1. Select Stake from the dashboard of your wallet. You should be taken to the ledger browser after that. A list of all current validators with whom you can

   stake your FETs can be found here. Additionally, you can view the FET staked to each validator as well as their commission rates.

1. Choose a validator to stake your FETs with, or use the search bar, and then click Stake or Unstake.
1. Enter the FETs you want to assign or remove stake from this validator, then click Stake/Unstake.
1. You may get a summary of the transaction in your Fetch Wallet. Review it,

   choose a transaction fee, and then click Approve to carry out the transaction if    you are satisfied.
